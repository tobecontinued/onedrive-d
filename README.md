## Overview

`onedrive-d` is a Microsoft OneDrive client on Linux platforms. It allows a Linux user to sync with one or more
OneDrive Personal account by synchronizing each remote OneDrive repository with a designated local directory. __Note
that OneDrive for Business is not supported (see [issue #2](https://github.com/xybu/onedrive-d/issues/2)).__

## Pre-requisites

`onedrive-d` is written in Python 3 and does ___NOT___ run under Python 2.x. The package is tested for the following
Python versions: `3.2`, `3.3`, `3.4`, `3.5-dev`.

To check if you have the correct Python interpreter, run

```bash
$ python3 --version
```

~~Because the CLI runs as a Linux daemon and some dependency packages are written in CPython, some system-level packages
are required: `python3-dev` (on Fedora / SUSE it is called `python3-devel`). If you do not have `gcc` installed, for
example, on Debian 8, you may also need to install the package `gcc`.~~

A low-level package required is `inotify-tools` (for most Linux distributes).

It is suggested that you install the latest version of `pip3` and `setuptools`:
```bash
# Download the latest pip package from source
$ wget -O- https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python3

# Use pip3 to upgrade setuptools
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
```

It is very important that your system hardware clock is set to UTC. Refer to `man tzconfig` for more details.

## Install

After properly setting up pre-requisites, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
# use sudo to install the package system-wide
$ python3 setup.py build
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Note: GUI will be implemented in a separate package as an `onedrive-d` extension.
